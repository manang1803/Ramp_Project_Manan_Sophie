# Ramp_Project_Manan_Sophie
In this project, we build a model to predict the number of bikes passing bike
counting stations in Paris each hour. We begin with a description of the data, including additional features
that we found in external sources. Next, we summarise the exploratory data analysis that we conducted,
before moving on p the feature engineering and missing value imputation methods. Then we
summarise and compare the models that we used, and analyse our results, giving some interpretation. Finally,
we conclude that our best model was a tuned version of a regularised gradient descent algorithm (XGBoost),
and summarise how we optimised our model.
